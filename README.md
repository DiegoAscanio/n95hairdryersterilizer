# n95hairdryersterilizer

A DIY N95 Breather / Medical Masks Automated Sterilizer built over SONG et al. (2020) findings about heat inactivation of virus contamination on medical masks (http://jmi.fudan.edu.cn/EN/abstract/abstract820.shtml)

For personal use only, according to SONG et al., this technique shouldn't be used in health facilities or by health workers, but, in places with precarious infrastructure (very poor cities, countries, etc), it might be better than nothing.
